# :tennis: Pong :tennis:

This is a not-so-exact replica of the Atari's Pong game, written in Python 3 with Pygame.

### :scroll: Requirements

This game was written in `Python 3` using the `Pygame` library. Thus, you must install both to get started.

### :rocket: How to launch/execute

In order to play the game, execute the `pong.py` file.

### :key: Controls

- `A` and `Z` control the left paddle. `K` and `M` control the right paddle.

- To start a new match, press `Space`.

- To stop a match in progress, press `Esc`.

### :video_game: How to play

This is a two player's game, which means you will need a friend to play it.

Or you can just control both paddles and compete against yourself :sunglasses:

The objetive of the game is to score points by making the opponent miss the ball.

The player who first scores :keycap_ten: points wins.

While the game is running and no one scores a point, the ball' speed increases.

Every time someone scores, the paddles reduce theirs sizes a little, to add some challenge.
