# Pong

This is a replica of the Atari's Pong game, with some small modifications.

### Requirements

This game was written in Python using the `pygame` library. Thus, you must install both to get started.

### How to execute

In order to play the game, clone/download it and execute the `pong.py` file.

### Controls

`A` and `Z` control the left paddle. `K` and `M` control the right paddle.

To start the game, press `Space`. To stop a started match, press `Esc`.

### How to play

This is a two player's game, which means you will need a friend to play it.

Or you can just control both paddles and compete against yourself :)

The objetive of the game is to score points by making the opponent miss the ball.

The player who first scores 10 points wins.

While the game is running no one scores a point, the ball' speed increases.

Every time someone scores, the paddles reduce theirs sizes a little, to add some challenge.
